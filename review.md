# Recite

Good morning/afternoon, respected professors.

My name is Zheng Haibin, and I am 22 years old from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications which short name is NJUPT, and I am honored to have the opportunity to join the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) for my graduate studies.

During my undergraduate studies, I achieved an average GPA of 3.66/5.0, ranking in the top 24% among 270 classmates at NJUPT. I have demonstrated strong English proficiency with scores of 653 in CET-4 and 559 in CET-6. My research interests primarily focus on computer vision and machine learning, and I am eager to explore these fields further at UESTC.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable research experience through projects such as "Setting up a PyTorch Development Environment Based on WSL2 and Reproducing ResNet34" and "Building a Zotero Reference Management System." These projects have allowed me to develop robust technical skills in Python programming, PyTorch, and related technologies. I am confident that these experiences have equipped me with the necessary foundation to excel in advanced research in the near future.

In addition to my academic achievements, I actively participated in campus activities and practical work. As the financial officer of the 858 Street Dance Club—ranked as the best among the top 10 student organizations at my university—I was responsible for managing financial affairs and assisting in major asset decisions. I also played a significant role in organizing various club activities and supporting important projects such as "The Four Provincial Award-Winning Projects of Jiangsu Group Dance." These experiences have honed my organizational, teamwork, and leadership skills.

In my free time, I enjoy fitness, running, and street dancing, which help me maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. I am detail-oriented, optimistic, and passionate about continuous learning. I believe these qualities will enable me to excel in your research group and contribute meaningfully to the academic community at UESTC.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my introduction. I look forward to discussing my application with you and learning more about the program at UESTC.

Thank you!
